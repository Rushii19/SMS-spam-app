SMS Spam Detection

🚀 Overview
SMS Spam Detection is a machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.


🚀 Features-

✔️ Detects spam messages using machine learning.

✔️ Uses TF-IDF Vectorization for text processing.

✔️ Supports Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM models.

✔️ Interactive Streamlit Web App for real-time predictions.

✔️ Lightweight and easy to deploy.


🛠️ Tech Stack-

🔹 Python – Programming Language

🔹 Pandas, NumPy – Data Processing

🔹 NLTK, Scikit-learn – Machine Learning & NLP

🔹 Streamlit – Web App Interface

🔹 Jupyter Notebook – Model Development


📂 Dataset-
We use the available SMS Spam Collection Dataset. The dataset contains ham (not spam) and spam messages, labeled accordingly.


🎯 How It Works-

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing – Remove stopwords, punctuation, and tokenize text.

2️⃣ Feature Extraction – Convert text into numerical form using TF-IDF.

3️⃣ Model Training – Train Naïve Bayes / SVM / Random Forest model.

4️⃣ Prediction – Classify messages as Spam or Ham.

5️⃣ Deployment – Web-based UI using Streamlit.


🔮 Future Enhancements-

✅ Improve model accuracy with deep learning (LSTM, BERT).

✅ Deploy as a web API for real-world applications.

✅ Add multilingual spam detection.
