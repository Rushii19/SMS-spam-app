SMS Spam Detection


SMS Spam Detection is a machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages TF-IDF vectorization for text processing and models like NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM for classification. The project includes a Streamlit-based web application for easy user interaction, enabling real-time message classification. Future improvements could involve deep learning models (LSTM, BERT) and API deployment for real-world applications. ðŸš€
