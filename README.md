SMS Spam Detection
Overview
SMS Spam Detection is a machine learning model that takes an SMS as input and predicts whether the message is a spam or not spam message. The model is built using Python and deployed on the web using Streamlit.

📌 Overview

SMS Spam Detection is a machine learning-based project that classifies text messages as either Spam or Not Spam (Ham). The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text and train a model for accurate classification.


🚀 Features

✔️ Detects spam messages using machine learning.

✔️ Uses TF-IDF Vectorization for text processing.

✔️ Supports Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM models.

✔️ Interactive Streamlit Web App for real-time predictions.

✔️ Lightweight and easy to deploy.

🛠️ Tech Stack

🔹 Python – Programming Language
🔹 Pandas, NumPy – Data Processing
🔹 NLTK, Scikit-learn – Machine Learning & NLP
🔹 Streamlit – Web App Interface
🔹 Jupyter Notebook – Model Development


📂 Dataset

We use the SMS Spam Collection Dataset available. The dataset contains ham (not spam) and spam messages, labeled accordingly.


🎯 How It Works

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing – Remove stopwords, punctuation, and tokenize text.
2️⃣ Feature Extraction – Convert text into numerical form using TF-IDF.
3️⃣ Model Training – Train Naïve Bayes / SVM / Random Forest model.
4️⃣ Prediction – Classify messages as Spam or Ham.
5️⃣ Deployment – Web-based UI using Streamlit.


🔮 Future Enhancements

✅ Improve model accuracy with deep learning (LSTM, BERT).
✅ Deploy as a web API for real-world applications.
✅ Add multilingual spam detection.
